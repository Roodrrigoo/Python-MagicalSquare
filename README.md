# Magic Square Game in Python

## Project Description

This project consists of the development of a Python game based on the creation and manipulation of a 5x5 magic square. In this game, the player is presented with a square where the objective is to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same.

The purpose of this project is to encourage and develop key skills in programming with arrays in Python, as well as in the use of lists and loops. Throughout the game, the player must interact with the structure of the magic square, applying principles of logic and mathematical reasoning to solve the challenge.

This project was designed as a tool to strengthen the understanding of data structures such as arrays, while also improving the handling of control flow in Python through the use of nested loops and the efficient manipulation of lists. It also promotes learning logical and mathematical patterns through problem-solving.

This game is ideal for those who wish to hone their programming skills and learn how to implement algorithms involving arrays and numerical calculations in an interactive environment.
